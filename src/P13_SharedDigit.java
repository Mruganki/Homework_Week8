/*
Shared Digit
t  within the range, the method should return false.
The method should return true if there is a digit that appears in both numbers, such as 2 in 12 and 23;  otherwise, the meWrite a method named hasSharedDigit with two parameters of type int.
Each number should be within the range of 10 (inclusive) - 99 (inclusive). If one of the numbers is nothod should return false.
EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
* hasSharedDigit(12, 23); â†’ should return true since the digit 2 appears in both numbers
* hasSharedDigit(9, 99); â†’ should return false since 9 is not within the range of 10-99
* hasSharedDigit(15, 55); â†’ should return true since the digit 5 appears in both numbers NOTE: The method hasSharedDigit should be defined as public static
